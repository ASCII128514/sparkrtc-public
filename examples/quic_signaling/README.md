# QUIC Transport Channel for WebRTC Signaling

This example demonstrates how to use Google's QUIC protocol for WebRTC signaling. The implementation uses the quiche library, which is Google's implementation of the QUIC protocol.

## Overview

The QUIC Transport Channel provides a reliable, secure, and low-latency transport for WebRTC signaling messages. It implements both the `IceTransportInternal` and `DataChannelTransportInterface` interfaces, allowing it to be used for both ICE connectivity and data channel operations.

Key features:
- Uses QUIC for reliable, secure transport
- Supports ICE connectivity establishment
- Provides data channel functionality for signaling
- Integrates with WebRTC's existing port allocation and ICE infrastructure

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of the following components:

1. `QuicheTransportChannel` - The main class that implements the transport channel
2. Integration with WebRTC's ICE infrastructure
3. Integration with the quiche library for QUIC protocol support
4. Data channel functionality for signaling message exchange

## Usage

To use the QUIC Transport Channel for signaling:

1. Create a `QuicheTransportChannel` instance
2. Set ICE parameters and role
3. Start gathering candidates
4. Exchange candidates with the remote peer
5. Use the data channel interface to send and receive signaling messages

See the `quic_signaling_example.cc` file for a complete example.

## Building and Running

To build the example:

```bash
gn gen out/Default
ninja -C out/Default examples/quic_signaling:quic_signaling_example
```

To run the example:

```bash
./out/Default/quic_signaling_example
```

## Dependencies

- WebRTC
- quiche library (Google's QUIC implementation)

## Future Improvements

- Add support for multiple streams
- Improve error handling and recovery
- Add congestion control optimizations
- Add support for 0-RTT connection establishment
- Add support for connection migration
